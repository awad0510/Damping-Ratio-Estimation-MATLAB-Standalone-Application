This standalone MATLAB application is developed as part of my MSc research to estimate the damping ratio of linear and nonlinear single degree of freedom vibration systems using three different techniques:

Logarithmic Decrement (LD)

Hilbert Transform (HT)

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)

The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to:

Load and visualize time-domain vibration data.

Perform signal smoothing and preprocessing.

Automatically detect peaks and extract oscillation cycles.

Compute damping ratio using the selected method.

Display envelope and phase plots for HT and CWT methods.

Export results for reporting and further analysis.

Key Features
No MATLAB installation required â€“ provided as a compiled standalone .exe application.

Multiple damping estimation methods in one tool for comparison and validation.

Customizable parameters for peak detection and signal analysis.

Interactive plots to visualize results and method differences.

Application in Research & Engineering
This tool is suitable for:

Mechanical, civil, and structural engineers analyzing free-vibration responses.

Researchers working on signal processing for structural health monitoring.

Students learning vibration analysis techniques.
